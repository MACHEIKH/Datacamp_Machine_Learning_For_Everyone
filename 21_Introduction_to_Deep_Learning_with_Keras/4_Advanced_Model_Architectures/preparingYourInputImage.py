# Preparing your input image
# The original ResNet50 model was trained with images of size 224 x 224 pixels and a number of preprocessing operations; like the subtraction of the mean pixel value in the training set for all training images. You need to pre-process the images you want to predict on in the same way.

# When predicting on a single image you need it to fit the model's input shape, which in this case looks like this: (batch-size, width, height, channels),np.expand_dims with parameter axis = 0 adds the batch-size dimension, representing that a single image will be passed to predict. This batch-size dimension value is 1, since we are only predicting on one image.

# You will go over these preprocessing steps as you prepare this dog's (named Ivy) image into one that can be classified by ResNet50.


# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Import image from keras.preprocessing and preprocess_input from keras.applications.resnet50.
# Load the image with the right target_size for your model.
# Turn it into an array with image.img_to_array().
# Pre-process img_expanded the same way the original ResNet50 training images were processed with preprocess_input().


# Import image and preprocess_input
from keras.preprocessing import image
from keras.applications.resnet50 import preprocess_input

# Load the image with the right target size for your model
img = image.load_img(img_path, target_size=(224, 224))

# Turn it into an array
img_array = image.img_to_array(img)

# Expand the dimensions of the image, this is so that it fits the expected model input format
img_expanded = np.expand_dims(img_array, axis = 0)

# Pre-process the img in the same way original images were
img_ready = preprocess_input(img_expanded)
