# The history callback
# The history callback is returned by default every time you train a model with the .fit() method. To access these metrics you can access the history dictionary parameter inside the returned h_callback object with the corresponding keys.

# The irrigation machine model you built in the previous lesson is loaded for you to train, along with its features and labels now loaded as X_train, y_train, X_test, y_test. This time you will store the model's historycallback and use the validation_data parameter as it trains.

# You will plot the results stored in history with plot_accuracy() and plot_loss(), two simple matplotlib functions. You can check their code in the console by pasting show_code(plot_loss).

# Let's see the behind the scenes of our training!

# Instructions
# 100 XP
# Train your model on X_train and y_train, validate each epoch on X_test and y_test.
# Use plot_lossextracting lossand val_loss from h_callback.
# Use plot_accuracyextracting accand val_acc from h_callback.


# Train your model and save its history
h_callback = model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs = 50,
               validation_data=(X_test, y_test))

# Plot train vs test loss during training
plot_loss(h_callback.history['loss'], h_callback.history['val_loss'])

# Plot train vs test accuracy during training
plot_accuracy(h_callback.history['acc'], h_callback.history['val_acc'])
